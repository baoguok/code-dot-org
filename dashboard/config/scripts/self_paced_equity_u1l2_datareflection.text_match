# Sources of Data

<div style="width:60%;">

#### When considering the sources of data available to you to inform your understanding of access, inclusion and diversity of CS at your school, itâ€™s useful think about the following key questions:
* #### Who has access to CS at my school?
* #### Who is in my CS class?
* #### How can students feel they belong in my CS classroom?

#### Consider also:
* #### What from this is in your locus of control? 

#### Using data at your school level can be powerful for investigating equity in computer science. Data might be quantitative or qualitative in nature, and can include:

## Quantitive vs Qualitative Data

</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; width: 60%;">
    <div style="background-color: #ffffff; box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; width: 30%;">
        <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.25; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Quantitative Data:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 1.5; padding: 0;">
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Attendance</li>
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">School Demographics</li>
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">CS course enrollment</li>
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">CS course progress</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #ffffff; box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; width: 30%;">
        <p style="color: black; line-height: 1.25; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Qualitative Data:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 1.5; padding: 0;">
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Learner profiles to get to know students and their learning preferences</li>
            <li style="font-size: 16px;">Student self-assessments/reflections to get to know what contributes or detracts from their learning</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

### Consider the following examples:

<div style="background-color: #F7F8FA; border-radius: 40px; color: #000000; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left; width: 60%">
	<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin: 10px; font-size: 18px;">
		A <b>3rd grade teacher</b> notices that students approach coding challenges in CS class differently. During her last lesson, 5 students did not complete any coding challenges, and 3 students stayed during recess to finish them all. She uses this information as data.
	</p>
</div>
    
<div style="background-color: #F7F8FA; border-radius: 40px; color: #000000; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left; width: 60%">
	<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin: 10px; font-size: 18px;">
		A <b>9th and 10th grade teacher</b> just got their roster for their CS class. The roster is a data set for them as it tells them some basic data about who is in their class - how many students enrolled, what gender they are, what grade, or what race or ethnicity the students are. Teacher X also has access to school wide data about grade, gender, and race or ethnicity that they can evaluate as well.

## Reflection

#### What data do you have access to in your school or district?
#### What steps can you take to access additional data about your students?
