While you read, consider which strategies under *asset-based pedagogy* you're already using, and which ones you'd like to try first in your classroom.\r\n\r\n## Examples of Asset-Based Pedagogy\r\n\r\n* #### Maintain high expectations for all students while providing them with the tools they need to succeed.\r\n* #### Display student projects and contributions in your classroom.\r\n* #### Arrange the learning space to promote collaboration and hands-on activities.\r\n* #### <a href=\"https://www.nc2ml.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Assigning-T_L.pdf\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Assign competence</a> to students when you notice their contributions in class.\r\n\t* #### **Example**: \"_Let's take a look at how Alexis creatively solved this coding challenge using if-statements.

Listen to her explain the bug so we can all learn from how she fixed her mistake.\"_\r\n* ####Model a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0y94NsxP6kQGZyTcML3l5aR0Uiaqm9K1qQ7PVIVrCo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lead learner</a> mentality, and position students as experts alongside you.\r\n\t* #### **Example**: _\"Hmm, I'm not sure how to fix this problem myself. If we go line-by-line and check our code, I'm sure we can solve this problem together.\"_\r\n* #### Build a coding identity for all students to see themselves in computer science.\r\n\t* #### **Example**: _\"Good morning coders!
